hi everyone myself Rakshith you can call me Rakshi😁.

this is a library management project. it consists of 2 models

1. Book with the basic properties like name, price, author etc
2. A user (Librarian) with a properties like name, age, gender, email, password etc

here we can add book to the library. also it can be borrowed and return by the user.

if you want to work with mysql database please use mysql profile.

or if you are good with h2 database please provide proper url(i used to store it permanent)

to access swagger use /swagger-ui/index.html
thank you 😘💕💕
